## PeterO.Text.Encodings

    public static class Encodings

Contains methods for converting text from one character encoding to another. This class also contains convenience methods for converting strings and other character inputs to sequences of bytes and vice versa.The Encoding Standard, which is a Candidate Recommendation as of early November 2015, defines algorithms for the most common character encodings used on Web pages and recommends the UTF-8 encoding for new specifications and Web pages. Calling the `GetEncoding(name)`  method returns one of the character encodings with the given name under the Encoding Standard.

Now let's define some terms.

<b>Encoding Terms</b>

 * A <b>code point</b> is a number that identifies a single text character, such as a letter, digit, or symbol.

 * A <b>character set</b> is a set of code points which are each assigned to a single text character. (This may also be called a<i>coded character set</i>.) As used here, character sets don't define how code points are laid out in memory.

 * A <b>character encoding</b> is a mapping from a sequence of code points, in one or more specific character sets, to a sequence of bytes and vice versa.

 * <b>ASCII</b> is a 128-code-point character set that includes the English letters and digits, common punctuation and symbols, and control characters. As used here, its code points match the code points within the Basic Latin range (0-127 or U+0000 to U+007F) of the Unicode Standard.

There are several kinds of character encodings:

 * <b>Single-byte encodings</b> define a character set that assigns one code point to one byte. Thus, they can have a maximum of 256 code points. For example:

 * (a) ISO 8859 encodings and  `windows-1252` .

 * (b) ASCII is usually used as a single-byte encoding where each code point fits in the lower 7 bits of an eight-bit byte. In the Encoding Standard, all single-byte encodings use the ASCII characters as the first 128 code points of their character sets.

 * <b>Multi-byte encodings</b> include code points from one or more character sets and assign some or all code points to several bytes. For example:

 * (a) UTF-16 uses 2 bytes for the most common Unicode code points and 4 bytes for supplementary code points.

 * (b)  `utf-8`  uses 1 byte for ASCII and 2 to 4 bytes for the other Unicode code points.

 * (c) Most legacy East Asian encodings, such as `shift_jis` ,  `gbk` , and  `big5`  use 1 byte for ASCII (or a slightly modified version) and, usually, 2 or more bytes for national standard character sets. In many of these encodings, notably  `shift_jis` , characters whose code points use one byte traditionally take half the space of characters whose code points use two bytes.

 * <b>Escape-based encodings</b> are combinations of single- and/or multi-byte encodings, and use escape sequences and/or shift codes to change which encoding to use for the bytes that follow. For example:

 * (a)  `iso-2022-jp`  supports several escape sequences that shift into different encodings, including a Katakana, a Kanji, and an ASCII encoding (with ASCII as the default).

 * (b) UTF-7 (not included in the Encoding Standard) is a Unicode encoding that uses a limited subset of ASCII. The plus symbol is used to shift into a modified version of base-64 to encode other Unicode code points.

 * The Encoding Standard also defines a <b>replacement encoding</b>, which causes a decoding error and is used to alias a few problematic or unsupported encoding names, such as `hz-gb-2312` .

<b>Getting an Encoding</b>

The Encoding Standard includes UTF-8, UTF-16, and many legacy encodings, and gives each one of them a name. The `GetEncoding(name)`  method takes a name string and returns an ICharacterEncoding object that implements that encoding, or `null`  if the name is unrecognized.

However, the Encoding Standard is designed to include only encodings commonly used on Web pages, not in other protocols such as email. For email, the Encoding class includes an alternate function  `GetEncoding(name, forEmail)` . Setting `forEmail`  to  `true`  will use rules modified from the Encoding Standard to better suit encoding and decoding text from email messages.

<b>Classes for Character Encodings</b>

This Encodings class provides access to common character encodings through classes as described below:

 * An <b>encoder class</b> is a class that converts a sequence of bytes to a sequence of code points in the universal character set (otherwise known under the name Unicode). An encoder class implements the  `ICharacterEncoder`  interface.

 * A <b>decoder class</b> is a class that converts a sequence of Unicode code points to a sequence of bytes. A decoder class implements the  `ICharacterDecoder`  interface.

 * An <b>encoding class</b> allows access to both an encoder class and a decoder class and implements the `ICharacterEncoding`  interface. The encoder and decoder classes should implement the same character encoding.

<b>Custom Encodings</b>

Classes that implement the ICharacterEncoding interface can provide additional character encodings not included in the Encoding Standard. Some examples of these include the following:

 * A modified version of UTF-8 used in Java's serialization formats.

 * A modified version of UTF-7 used in the IMAP email protocol.

(Note that this library doesn't implement either encoding.)

### UTF8

        this PeterO.Text.ICharacterEncoding encoding,
        PeterO.IByteReader stream);

Converts a character encoding into a character input stream, given a streamable source of bytes. The input stream doesn't check the first few bytes for a byte-order mark indicating a Unicode encoding such as UTF-8 before using the character encoding's decoder.In the .NET implementation, this method is implemented as an extension method to any object implementing ICharacterEncoding and can be called as follows: "encoding.GetDecoderInput(input)".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>encoding</i>: Encoding that exposes a decoder to be converted into a character input stream. If the decoder returns -2 (indicating a decode error), the character input stream handles the error by returning a replacement character in its place.

        PeterO.IByteReader stream);

Converts a character encoding into a character input stream, given a streamable source of bytes. But if the input stream starts with a UTF-8 or UTF-16 byte order mark, the input is decoded as UTF-8 or UTF-16, as the case may be, rather than the given character encoding.This method implements the "decode" algorithm specified in the Encoding standard.

In the .NET implementation, this method is implemented as an extension method to any object implementing ICharacterEncoding and can be called as follows: `encoding.GetDecoderInputSkipBom(input)` . If the object's class already has a  `GetDecoderInputSkipBom`  method with the same parameters, that method takes precedence over this extension method.

### ResolveAlias

    public static string ResolveAlias(
        string name);

Resolves a character encoding's name to a standard form. This involves changing aliases of a character encoding to a standardized name.In several Internet standards, this name is known as a "charset" parameter. In HTML and HTTP, for example, the "charset" parameter indicates the encoding used to represent text in the HTML page, text file, etc.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>name</i>: A string that names a given character encoding. Can be null. Any leading and trailing whitespace is removed and the name converted to lowercase before resolving the encoding's name. The Encoding Standard supports only the following encodings (and defines aliases for most of them):.

 *  `utf-8`  - UTF-8 (8-bit encoding of the universal character set, the encoding recommended by the Encoding Standard for new data formats)

 *  `utf-16le`  - UTF-16 little-endian (16-bit UCS)

 *  `utf-16be`  - UTF-16 big-endian (16-bit UCS)

 * The special-purpose encoding  `x-user-defined`

 * The special-purpose encoding  `replacement` , which this function returns only if one of several aliases are passed to it, as defined in the Encoding Standard.

 * 28 legacy single-byte encodings:

 *  `windows-1252`  : Western Europe (Note: The Encoding Standard aliases the names  `us-ascii`  and  `iso-8859-1`  to `windows-1252` , which uses a different character set from either; it differs from  `iso-8859-1`  by assigning different characters to some bytes from 0x80 to 0x9F. The Encoding Standard does this for compatibility with existing Web pages.)

 *  `iso-8859-2` ,  `windows-1250`  : Central Europe

 *  `iso-8859-10`  : Northern Europe

 *  `iso-8859-4` ,  `windows-1257`  : Baltic

 *  `iso-8859-13`  : Estonian

 *  `iso-8859-14`  : Celtic

 *  `iso-8859-16`  : Romanian

 *  `iso-8859-5` ,  `ibm866` ,  `koi8-r` , `windows-1251` ,  `x-mac-cyrillic`  : Cyrillic

 *  `koi8-u`  : Ukrainian

 *  `iso-8859-7` ,  `windows-1253`  : Greek

 *  `iso-8859-6` ,  `windows-1256`  : Arabic

 *  `iso-8859-8` ,  `iso-8859-8-i` ,  `windows-1255` : Hebrew

 *  `iso-8859-3`  : Latin 3

 *  `iso-8859-15`  : Latin 9

 *  `windows-1254`  : Turkish

 *  `windows-874`  : Thai

 *  `windows-1258`  : Vietnamese

 *  `macintosh`  : Mac Roman

 * Three legacy Japanese encodings:  `shift_jis` , `euc-jp` ,  `iso-2022-jp`

 * Two legacy simplified Chinese encodings:  `gbk`  and `gb18030`

 *  `big5`  : legacy traditional Chinese encoding

 *  `euc-kr`  : legacy Korean encoding

The  `utf-8` ,  `utf-16le` , and  `utf-16be` encodings don't encode a byte-order mark at the start of the text (doing so is not recommended for  `utf-8` , while in `utf-16le`  and  `utf-16be` , the byte-order mark character U+FEFF is treated as an ordinary character, unlike in to the UTF-16 encoding form). The Encoding Standard aliases  `utf-16` to  `utf-16le`  "to deal with deployed content".

.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A standardized name for the encoding. Returns the empty string if  <i>name</i>
 is null or empty, or if the encoding name is unsupported.

### ResolveAliasForEmail

    public static string ResolveAliasForEmail(
        string name);

Resolves a character encoding's name to a canonical form, using rules more suitable for email.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>name</i>: A string naming a character encoding. Can be null. Uses a modified version of the rules in the Encoding Standard to better conform, in some cases, to email standards like MIME. In addition to the encodings mentioned in ResolveAlias, the following additional encodings are supported:.

 *  `us-ascii`  - ASCII single-byte encoding, rather than an alias to  `windows-1252` , as specified in the Encoding Standard.

 *  `iso-8859-1`  - Latin-1 single-byte encoding, rather than an alias to  `windows-1252` , as specified in the Encoding Standard.

 *  `utf-7`  - UTF-7 (7-bit universal character set).

.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A standardized name for the encoding. Returns the empty string if  <i>name</i>
 is null or empty, or if the encoding name is unsupported.

### StringToBytes

    public static byte[] StringToBytes(
        this PeterO.Text.ICharacterEncoder encoder,
        string str);

Converts a text string to a byte array using the given character encoder. When reading the string, any unpaired surrogate characters are replaced with the replacement character (U+FFFD), and when writing to the byte array, any characters that can't be encoded are replaced with the byte 0x3f (the question mark character).In the .NET implementation, this method is implemented as an extension method to any object implementing ICharacterEncoder and can be called as follows:  `encoder.StringToBytes(str)` . If the object's class already has a StringToBytes method with the same parameters, that method takes precedence over this extension method.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>encoder</i>: An object that implements a character encoder.

 * <i>str</i>: A text string to encode into a byte array.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A byte array.

<b>Exceptions:</b>

 * System.ArgumentNullException:
The parameter <i>encoder</i>
 or  <i>str</i>
 is null.

### StringToBytes

    public static byte[] StringToBytes(
        this PeterO.Text.ICharacterEncoding encoding,
        string str);

Converts a text string to a byte array encoded in a given character encoding. When reading the string, any unpaired surrogate characters are replaced with the replacement character (U+FFFD), and when writing to the byte array, any characters that can't be encoded are replaced with the byte 0x3f (the question mark character).In the .NET implementation, this method is implemented as an extension method to any object implementing ICharacterEncoding and can be called as follows:  `encoding.StringToBytes(str)` . If the object's class already has a StringToBytes method with the same parameters, that method takes precedence over this extension method.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>encoding</i>: An object that implements a character encoding.

 * <i>str</i>: A string to be encoded into a byte array.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A byte array containing the string encoded in the given text encoding.

<b>Exceptions:</b>

 * System.ArgumentNullException:
The parameter <i>encoding</i>
 is null.

### StringToInput

    public static PeterO.Text.ICharacterInput StringToInput(
        this string str);

Converts a text string to a character input. The resulting input can then be used to encode the text to bytes, or to read the string code point by code point, among other things. When reading the string, any unpaired surrogate characters are replaced with the replacement character (U+FFFD).In the .NET implementation, this method is implemented as an extension method to any String object and can be called as follows: `str.StringToInput(offset, length)` . If the object's class already has a StringToInput method with the same parameters, that method takes precedence over this extension method.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>str</i>: A text string.

<b>Return Value:</b>

An ICharacterInput object.

<b>Exceptions:</b>

 * System.ArgumentNullException:
The parameter <i>str</i>
 is null.

### StringToInput

    public static PeterO.Text.ICharacterInput StringToInput(
        this string str,
        int offset,
        int length);

Converts a portion of a text string to a character input. The resulting input can then be used to encode the text to bytes, or to read the string code point by code point, among other things. When reading the string, any unpaired surrogate characters are replaced with the replacement character (U+FFFD).In the .NET implementation, this method is implemented as an extension method to any String object and can be called as follows: `str.StringToInput(offset, length)` . If the object's class already has a StringToInput method with the same parameters, that method takes precedence over this extension method.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>str</i>: A text string.

 * <i>offset</i>: A zero-based index showing where the desired portion of  <i>str</i>
 begins.

 * <i>length</i>: The length, in code units, of the desired portion of  <i>str</i>
 (but not more than  <i>str</i>
 's length).

<b>Return Value:</b>

An ICharacterInput object.

<b>Exceptions:</b>

 * System.ArgumentNullException:
The parameter <i>str</i>
 is null.

 * System.ArgumentException:
Either  <i>offset</i>
 or  <i>length</i>
 is less than 0 or greater than  <i>str</i>
 's length, or  <i>str</i>
 ' s length minus  <i>offset</i>
 is less than  <i>length</i>
.
